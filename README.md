The data we are using records the number of times certain words are said by presidental candidates in political debates, offical speeches, etc.

We will be parsing transcripts of debates and finding the most commonly said words, which are then displayed as circles of size corresponding to how many times they are said. 

Taking transcripts of recent political debates from here:
